# Minecraft Clone

A Minecraft clone written in C99 and OpenGL

## How to run

This has only been tested on a MacOS system, so to build on there, run these commands from the base directory

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./minecraft
```

All dependencies (GLFW and Glad) will be automatically fetched and installed by CMake
